# Chubak's Markdown Codices and Parchments

I'm going to treat this repository as some sort of a blog. My reasoning is, these days, people are usually directed towards blog posts from either Google or social media. Github has good SEO and I can always easily direct people to the Markdown file. Plus Github has great Markdown support that is not replicated in most blogging software, and I ain't got not time to roll out my own blog software, as I am a dummy in web dev.

So there you go, enjoy my Markdown Codices (codices is plural of codex, and codex is a large book that is not a facsimile).
Parchments are smaller codices.


Thanks.
